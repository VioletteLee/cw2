# Diet & Environmental Impact Visualization 🌍🥦🍖
This project visualizes the environmental impact of different diet groups using Radar Charts and Treemaps. The visualizations help compare key sustainability indicators across various diets, highlighting the differences in greenhouse gas emissions, water use, and land use.

## 📊 Visualizations
1️⃣ Radar Chart
Displays environmental impact indicators across different diet groups.

Each axis represents a key environmental factor, and the polygons show the relative impact of each diet.

Insight: The Meat100+ g/day group has the highest impact across most indicators, while vegan and vegetarian diets exhibit the lowest environmental burden.

2️⃣ Treemap
Hierarchical representation of the environmental impact of each diet.

Larger rectangles indicate a higher environmental footprint, with warmer colors representing greater impact.

Insight: The Meat100+ g/day group has the largest, warmest-colored rectangle, reinforcing its high impact, while vegan and vegetarian diets are smaller and cooler in color.

## 🚀 Features
✔ Interactive Visualization – Hover, zoom, and filter to explore the data.
✔ Multiple Environmental Indicators – GHG emissions, water scarcity, land use, eutrophication, and biodiversity impact.
✔ Clear & Engaging Representation – Color-coded insights to facilitate understanding.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
Jupyter Notebook – Data processing and visualization

Python (pandas, numpy) – Data manipulation

Plotly – Interactive charts and graphs
